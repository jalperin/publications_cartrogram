# Publications Cartograms
Cartograms showin world scaled by number of documents published with authors from each country 

This map was produced by Juan Pablo Alperin (Simon Fraser University) and Rodrigo Costas (Centre for Science and Technology Studies) as part of a larger research collaboration to study the production and readership by countries, and over time. Data about publications by country is sourced from Scopus and population and GDP data is sourced from the World Bank. The map is powered by [d3.js](http://d3js.org) using [cartogram.js](https://github.com/vasturiano/cartogram-chart) which itself relies on [this implementation](https://github.com/shawnbot/topogram) of Dougenik, Chrisman, Niemeyer ([1985](http://lambert.nico.free.fr/tp/biblio/Dougeniketal1985.pdf)).

A 2016 edition of this map can be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/World_scaled_by_number_of_documents_with_authors_from_each_country_in_Web_of_Science_2016/7064771) and a 2011 version, using data from Web of Science, is availble [here](https://figshare.com/articles/World_scaled_by_number_of_documents_in_Web_of_Science_2012_by_Authors_Living_There/953177%3E).
